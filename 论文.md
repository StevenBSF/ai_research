## Abstract

​	Multi-view clustering aims to extract effective semantic information from multiple views to obtain better features for clustering. However, most current methods are limited to capturing semantic features and constructing pseudo-labels to capture clustering information, while neglecting the differences among different views and the further extraction of common semantic features. As a result, for some more challenging task data, the presence of irrelevant information and differences in each view makes it difficult to effectively assess the actual semantic quality of different views, leading to insufficient extraction of the common semantic information across views. To solve the above problems, our goal is to extract causal semantic features and generalize the inputs of different views to obtain content that truly lacks view dependency. The challenge lies in how to handle the inputs, extract causal essential features from different views, and apply them to the task of multi-view clustering. To address this, we propose a novel model named **M**ulti-**S**tage **C**ausal Feature Learning for **M**ulti-**V**iew **C**lustering(MSC-MVC).We introduce a causal content label that enables the alignment of content features from different perspectives, thereby eliminating view dependency,and based on this,we assess view quality based on the composition of content features across different views. Additionally, we perform feature augmentation through Gaussian distribution sampling, using similarity graph constraints to mitigate the impact of differences between views. By leveraging causal content features, we can further construct pseudo-label graphs to supervise clustering information. Extensive experiments on seven datasets are performed to illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed model.

## Introduction

在过去几十年里，在机器学习和数据挖掘领域里Multi-View Clustering一直是一项火热并且长期处于关注焦点的任务。而多视角聚类的关键之处在于如何充分利用不同视图的有效语义信息将数据自监督地划分为一些各不相关地组别之中。对此，现阶段的对于多视角聚类这一任务的处理方法大致可以分为：基于non-negative matrix factorization,基于subspace learning, graph-based learning.

在这些方法中，特别是graph-based method虽然能够在较多的数据集上通过计算相似图和引入对比学习的方法来对齐latent representation获得了较为满意的结果，但是对于更深、更本质的层次的特征未能得到很好提取，从而导致了对于某些较难的数据集上出现了相较于其他方法在某些指标上面大幅崩溃的结果。For instance，DealMVC 通过结合对比学习和注意力机制融合不同视图的特征，pull close不同视图下不同样本以期望获得更集中的特征表示，在一些视图差异不大的一些数据集上获得了较好的结果，但是对于在一些视图差异较大的数据集上则出现了难以获得理想结果的情况，这是因为对于不同视图各自特征本身的内容和差异未能得到充分的挖掘，而弱化了模型的泛化能力。
