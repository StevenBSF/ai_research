## Abstract

â€‹	Multi-view clustering aims to extract effective semantic information from multiple views to obtain better features for clustering. However, most current methods are limited to capturing semantic features and constructing pseudo-labels to capture clustering information, while neglecting the differences among different views and the further extraction of common semantic features. As a result, for some more challenging task data, the presence of irrelevant information and differences in each view makes it difficult to effectively assess the actual semantic quality of different views, leading to insufficient extraction of the common semantic information across views. To solve the above problems, our goal is to extract causal semantic features and generalize the inputs of different views to obtain content that truly lacks view dependency. The challenge lies in how to handle the inputs, extract causal essential features from different views, and apply them to the task of multi-view clustering. To address this, we propose a novel model named **M**ulti-**S**tage **C**ausal Feature Learning for **M**ulti-**V**iew **C**lustering(MSC-MVC).We introduce a causal content label that enables the alignment of content features from different perspectives, thereby eliminating view dependency,and based on this,we assess view quality based on the composition of content features across different views. Additionally, we perform feature augmentation through Gaussian distribution sampling, using similarity graph constraints to mitigate the impact of differences between views. By leveraging causal content features, we can further construct pseudo-label graphs to supervise clustering information. Extensive experiments on seven datasets are performed to illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed model.
